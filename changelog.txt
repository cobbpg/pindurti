Link history view (only for raw linking) for calcs plugged into the hub.

Pressing Enter on the memory view pane allows modifying the contents of the mapped memory.
The resulting dialog can be used to enter a number (the following base postfixes are allowed:
b, B, d, D, h, H, o, O; the default is base 16).
Pressing Shift-Enter after typing the number writes a little-endian word instead of a byte.
Writing is handled by the z80 memory writing function with all the possible side effects,
so ROM cannot be overwritten this way.
ALT changed to Backspace for screenshotting.
